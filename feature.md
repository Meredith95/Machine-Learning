# Feature

## Data normalization

归一化 训练集某一列数值缩放到\[0，1\]

## Feature scaling

特征缩放/ 标准化（standardization）

训练集某一列数值缩放到标准正态分布，均值0，方差为1（z-score）

If we don’t know what features are important \(most often the case\), then it is worth scaling each feature \(for example, so their range is between 0 and 1 or their variance is 1\)
